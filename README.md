These are all datasets to play with for courses or learning. 

The ice cream dataset is from Janelle Shane, who writes: 
This is a dataset of 2,011 ice cream flavors collected by Anita Johnson's 2017-2018 coding classes at Kealing Middle School in Austin, Texas. The middle schoolers hand-collected these names in April 2018 and are generously allowing me to post them here for the community to use. A writeup of the project, including the middleschoolers' results from training textgenrnn on this dataset: http://aiweirdness.com/post/173797162852/ai-scream-for-ice-cream A sequel to the further experiment, in which I trained char-rnn on this dataset: http://aiweirdness.com/post/173990761332/generated-ice-cream-flavors-now-its-my-turn

I augmented the ice cream dataset by prompting ChatGPT to write new, punny ice cream flavors. 

The inspirational quotes dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattimansha/inspirational-quotes . I kept the original spelling of "insparational" in the file.
